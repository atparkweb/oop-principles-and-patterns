# Liskov Substitution Principle

```
Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.
```

## Summary

This principle is just an extension of the Open Close Principle in terms of behavior meaning that we must make sure that new derived classes are extending the base classes without changing their behavior. The new derived classes should be able to replace the base classes without any change in the code.

Liskov's Substitution Principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1987 Conference on Object Oriented Programming Systems Languages and Applications, inÂ [Data abstraction and hierarchy](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=62141)
